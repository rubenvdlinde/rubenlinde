In recent months, I've been thinking a lot about digital sovereignty and where we host our code. That's why I decided to migrate my projects to Codeberg. In this blog post, I explain why.

## Why Codeberg?

Codeberg is a European, open-source alternative to GitHub. It's run by a non-profit organization and focused on the community. Here are a few reasons why I chose Codeberg:

### 1. European and Independent

Codeberg is hosted in Europe and is not dependent on large American tech companies. This aligns well with my vision of digital sovereignty and a European digital infrastructure.

### 2. Open Source and Community-Driven

Unlike GitHub (which is owned by Microsoft), Codeberg is run by a non-profit organization. The platform itself is also open source, based on Gitea/Forgejo.

### 3. No Commercial Interests

Codeberg has no commercial interests and doesn't sell your data. They survive purely on donations and sponsorships from the community.

### 4. Focus on Privacy

Privacy is important at Codeberg. They don't track you and don't use analytics tools that follow you around the web.

## The Migration

Migrating from GitHub to Codeberg was surprisingly simple:

- Create an account on Codeberg
- Mirror or move your repositories
- Update your local git remotes
- Done!

## Conclusion

For developers who value digital sovereignty, privacy, and open source, Codeberg is an excellent alternative to GitHub. I'm happy to contribute to a more independent European digital infrastructure.
